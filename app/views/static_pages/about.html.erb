<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Lost-and-Found OS will serve as an online service website centered around users requesting other users’ aid in finding lost belongings. This innovative service will be purely based on members in a community interacting with one another. Users will be able make posts concerning lost items which includes: a brief description, location, last seen, and picture of the lost item on the website. Any fellow user, given that the he or she found the lost item, will then be able to update to the poster, and set up a location to meet up in order to return the item.
</p>
<p>
Returning items successfully will be rewarded with reputation points within a point-based, reputation system. As an extra incentive, users with lost items will be able to post personal rewards for lost items. The reward will be exchanged at the same time and location where lost items are returned. Users will be able to rate each other’s integrity, which will then effect the point-based reputation system.
